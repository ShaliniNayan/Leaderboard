<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Leaderboard List App Project<a name="Leaderboard List App Project"></a>

> "Leaderboard List App Project" The primary goal of this project is to build a functional app that displays a leaderboard list, following a given wireframe. The focus is on implementing the app's functionality, without any styling at first.

In subsequent activities, the app will be enhanced to consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript's async and await functionality. Additional styling will also be added to improve the app's user interface.

**Leaderboard List App Project** is a web project where i test my javascript, API and webpack programming skills.

<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

> The key features of the Leaderboard List App Project include:

- Displaying a leaderboard list: The app should be able to display a list of items in a tabular format, showing each item's name, rank, and score.

- Implementation of ES6 modules: The app should be developed using modern web development techniques such as ES6 modules to make it modular, maintainable, and easy to scale.

- Integration with webpack: Webpack should be used to bundle the app's modules, making it easy to deploy and manage.

- Implementation of filtering and sorting: The app could be enhanced with features that allow users to filter or sort the leaderboard list based on specific criteria such as the score or rank.

- Integration with Leaderboard API: The app could be enhanced to consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript's async and await functionality. This would enable the app to fetch data dynamically from the server and update the leaderboard list accordingly.

- Improved user interface design: The app could be enhanced with improved styling to make it more visually appealing and easier to use.
